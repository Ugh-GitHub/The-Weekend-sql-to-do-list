# Project Name

The Weekend SQL To-Do List

## Description

The problem solved was utilizing the AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) suite of methods to communicate with servers. In turn, we used a PostgreSQL database and related packages to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations with data from the database as well as from the server & front end.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js
-   PostgreSQL
-   Express
-   Body-Parser

## Intallation

1.  Create a database using the code from the database.sql file, located in the database_details directory in the server directory.
2.  Install all the prequisite software packages in the repository via the terminal (don't use a windows computer. Please.).
3.  Launch the server by typing node server/server.js.
4.  Open up "localhost:5000" in your preferred (but supported) web-browser (options include Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari, but possibly more).
5.  Add tasks via the field as desired, including whether or not they have been completed.
6.  Mark completed (or unmark), or delete tasks as needed through the button interfaces in the table.

##  Usage

This app can be used to keep track of tasks and objectives, marking them off in real time.

A user who has a messy house and a busy programming class and need to keep track of everything they need to complete in a day. This app allows them to refresh tasks on a new day if they are required daily, or delete instance specific tasks.

## Built with

Jquery, and all the above prequisite packages.
Tested with Jquery & Postico
